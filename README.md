# Creating videos with AI

I wanted to see if I could create text with AI, then create code to turn it into a video and upload it to social media.

# Process
The text is created using an ChatGPT and at the moment is manually created. But the plan is to find a similar AI that has an API which can be called in Python.

The text is then imported into Python and converted into a sound file using Microsft Azure's text-to-speech tool. The code then attaches the audio to a video file (which it chooses from a selection of created videos). Then finally uploads it to Tiktok.
